## Yarn (Berry)

Yarn has always been faster than npm hands down. With Yarn (Berry) and Plug'n'Play the installs are even better.

## Next.js

The choice was between Next.js, Gatsby.js and basic React. I'm already familiar with Next.js and wanted to continue learning more about it. It has great SEO capabilities and even SSG, which is perfect for this static project.
